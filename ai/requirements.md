### 3. Personalization

- Build and maintain user preference profiles
- Learn from user feedback and interactions
- Adapt recommendations based on:
  - Previous travel history
  - User ratings and reviews
  - Similar user patterns
  - Seasonal preferences

### 4. Optimization

- Optimize itineraries considering:
  - Time constraints
  - Distance between locations
  - Opening hours
  - Traffic patterns
  - Weather conditions
- Balance between popular attractions and hidden gems
- Consider user's physical capabilities and accessibility needs

### 5. Integration Requirements

- API endpoints for:
  - Recommendation generation
  - User preference management
  - Feedback collection
  - Real-time updates
- Integration with external services:
  - Weather APIs
  - Event calendars
  - Transportation schedules
  - Booking systems

### 6. Performance Requirements

- Response time < 2 seconds for recommendations
- Support for concurrent users
- Scalable architecture
- Efficient resource utilization

### 7. Data Management

- Secure storage of user preferences
- Regular updates of attraction and location data
- Compliance with data protection regulations
- Backup and recovery procedures

### 8. Monitoring and Analytics

- Track recommendation accuracy
- Monitor user satisfaction
- Analyze popular destinations and preferences
- Generate insights for business decisions

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Model Requirements

- Use of advanced machine learning models for:
  - Recommendation generation
  - Natural language processing
  - Pattern recognition
- Regular model updates and improvements
- Version control for models

### 2. Infrastructure

- Containerized deployment (Docker)
- Scalable cloud infrastructure
- Load balancing capabilities
- High availability setup

### 3. Security

- Secure API endpoints
- Data encryption
- Access control
- Regular security audits

## Future Enhancements

- Multi-modal recommendations (text, images, videos)
- Real-time itinerary adjustments
- Social features integration
- Advanced personalization using deep learning
- Voice interface support
- AR/VR integration for virtual previews

## Success Metrics

- User satisfaction rate
- Recommendation acceptance rate
- Response time
- System uptime
- User engagement metrics
- Conversion rates for bookings

## Setup and Running Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

### Local Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ai
```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

5. Run the application locally:

```bash
python run.py
```

### Docker Setup

1. Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t trip-planner-ai .
```

2. Run using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Running Tests

1. Run all tests:

```bash
pytest
```

2. Run specific test suite:

```bash
pytest tests/recommendation/
```

### API Documentation

Once the application is running, access the API documentation at:

- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- ReDoc: `http://localhost:8000/redoc`

### Monitoring

Access monitoring dashboards at:

- Prometheus: `http://localhost:9090`
- Grafana: `http://localhost:3000`

### Common Issues and Troubleshooting

1. If the model fails to load:

   - Check if all model files are present in the `model/` directory
   - Verify model version compatibility
   - Check system memory requirements

2. If API endpoints are not responding:

   - Verify the service is running
   - Check API logs
   - Verify environment variables

3. If recommendations are slow:
   - Check system resources
   - Verify cache configuration
   - Check database connection

### Deployment

1. Production deployment:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

2. Staging deployment:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml up -d
```

### Backup and Recovery

1. Database backup:

```bash
./scripts/backup.sh
```

2. Restore from backup:

```bash
./scripts/restore.sh <backup-file>
```
